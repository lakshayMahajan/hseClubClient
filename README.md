# Project Frontend - Student Club Management System

## Description

This project's frontend is a user-friendly web application that interacts with the backend API for managing student clubs and students. The frontend is built using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and accessible experience for users. Users can easily create, read, update, and delete information about clubs and students through the intuitive user interface.

## Features

- Responsive and accessible user interface
- Secure authentication and authorization for users
- Real-time data synchronization between frontend and backend
- CRUD operations for clubs and students through the UI

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14.x.x or later
- npm v7.x.x or later

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-club-management-frontend.git
   cd student-club-management-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   - Create a new `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following variables to the `.env` file, and replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=<your_backend_api_url>
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The server will now be running on the default port `3000` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`), or on the next available port if `3000` is in use.

## Testing

- To run tests for the frontend components, use the following command:

  ```
  npm test
  ```

## Build for Production

- To create an optimized production build, use the following command:

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

  This command will create a `build` folder containing the production-ready files.

## Deployment

- Follow the instructions in your preferred hosting platform's documentation to deploy the production build. Some popular options include [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
